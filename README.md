## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS variable fonts

### What I learned

Another very good project.  Helped me recall my knowlodge on box shadows and i was most impressed with my use of CSS variable fonts for the first time. I look forward to more enlightening projects moving forward.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf");
  font-display: swap;
}

```

### Continued development

I would want to improve on my css code optimization and naming conventions.
